Dear Dr. Kemp, \bigskip

Enclosed please find our manuscript, titled \`Fitting metabolic models
to dissolved oxygen data: The Estuarine BAyesian Single-station
Estimation method (EBASE)', to be considered as a description of new
methods in Limnology and Oceanography: Methods.

This work advances the study of metabolic rates in estuaries by
presenting a new Bayesian framework, EBASE, for fitting metabolic models
to dissolved oxygen data. We are unaware of any existing methods that
provide similar functionality in estuarine settings. We develop our
approach by building and improving upon a similar Bayesian model
developed for freshwater streams. Several parameters of the core
metabolic model were modified to better represent the dynamics of
estuaries. EBASE was also benchmarked against the conventional Odum
open-water method for estimating metabolism using a synthetic time
series with known results. Our results demonstrated that EBASE can
reproduce the known metabolic rates with reasonable certainty. Lastly,
the methods are available in an R package that includes options to vary
the prior distributions for the metabolic parameters and the amount of
data used in their estimation.

Each author has contributed substantially to this work. All authors have
contributed to the writing and review of the original draft. Further,
Dr. Ray Najjar was instrumental in conceptualization of the method and
Dr. Maria Herrmann greatly assisted in the methods assessment portion of
the manuscript. Dr. Arriola was responsible for discussing and testing
earlier versions of EBASE. All authors have approved the final draft.

We greatly appreciate the opportunity to publish this work in Limnology
and Oceanography Methods and are confident readers will consider it a
valuable contribution. Please feel free to contact us directly should
additional information be needed.
